What Does School Desk Do?
-------------------------

School Desk is an online homeschool planner.
The application is designed with simplicity in mind.
We don't plan to put every feature under the sun
into the app.

At the core,
**School Desk will automatically build your homeschool schedule
based on the courses and tasks
that you need
for your students**.

The idea is simple:
you tell us about your courses
and when you want them to run,
and School Desk figures out the rest.

The application tracks your students' progress
on their journey
through the school year.
Additionally, School Desk can track grades,
produce progress reports,
and other materials
that you may need to report
to your local government
as a homeschooling family.

.. note::

   School Desk is focused on your homeschool
   and your students.
   Our mission is to remove the management burden
   of scheduling,
   so that you get to focus
   on the more important work
   of teaching your students instead.
